# Happy plant application

This application is a plant care solution that uses IoT (Arduino) and mobile programming (Flutter) to provide optimal monitoring and management of plants. By integrating sensors with the application, users can easily monitor their plants' health and receive real-time data on their mobile devices. Users can monitor data registered by sensors in real-time, receive notifications for optimal conditions and access historical data and graphs for analysis.

## Backend (API): FastAPI with Python
## Frontend: Flutter
## Hardware: Arduino board, air humidity and temperature sensor, soil humidity sensor, light level sensor
